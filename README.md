# odin-recipes
This project is part of The Odin Project
Curriculum. I will create a simple recipe website with multiple pages using only HTML.

At the end of this project, I will be able to:
- Understand better the usual boilerplate HTML
- Use links to connect different pages in a website
- Insert images and other basic HTML tags (titles, paragraphs)
