    <h2>No need for store-bought pesto anymore. This recipe is so easy with just 5 ingredients. And it takes just 5 min
        to make too!</h2>
    <p>I somehow always have extra basil on hand so I’ve found myself making pesto on a weekly basis. It’s one of the
        easiest things to make – with the help of a food processor – and it requires so little ingredients!</p>
    <p>This is best made when using a food processor, not a blender. I have tried using a blender and the consistency
        just isn’t the same. And I know that pine nuts (also called pignolias) can be a bit pricey but one small 8-ounce
        bag of pine nuts will last you a lifetime. And it gives you an excuse to make more pesto for next time!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons pine nuts</li>
        <li>1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the pesto, combine basil, garlic, pine nuts and Parmesan in the bowl of a food processor; season
            with salt and pepper, to taste. With the motor running, add olive oil in a slow stream until emulsified; set
            aside.</li>
        <li>Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</li>
    </ol>
