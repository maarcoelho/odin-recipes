    <h2>Our best ever spaghetti bolognese is super easy and a true Italian classic with a meaty, chilli sauce.</h2>
    <p>It doesn’t take a lot of ingredients (or a lot of money) to make a classic Bolognese recipe. What it does take,
        though, is patience for the sauce to achieve the ideal authentic texture. You’re going to go low and slow—it’ll
        take around 3 hours, but most of that cook time is hands-off. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>2 sprigs of fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>6 rashers dry-cured higher-welfare smoked streaky bacon</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>500 g minced beef</li>
        <li>200 ml red wine</li>
        <li>1 x 280 g jar of sun-dried tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 x 400 g tins of plum tomatoes</li>
        <li>500 g dried spaghetti</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4.</li>
        <li>Peel and finely chop the garlic and onions, pick and finely chop the rosemary, then finely slice the bacon.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a splash of oil in a casserole pan on a medium heat, add the bacon, rosemary, garlic and onion and cook
            for 5 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add the minced beef, breaking it apart with the back of a spoon, then cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until
            starting to brown, then pour in the wine. Leave to bubble and cook away.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, drain and tip the sun-dried tomatoes into a food processor, blitz to a paste, then add to the pan
            with the tomatoes. Stir well, break the plum tomatoes apart a little.</li>
        <li>Cover with a lid then place in the oven for 1 hour, removing the lid and giving it a stir after 30 minutes –
            if it looks a little dry at this stage, add a splash of water to help it along.</li>
        <li>About 10 minutes before the time is up, cook the spaghetti in boiling salted water according to the packet
            instructions.</li>
        <li>Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain, reserving a mugful of cooking water, then return to the pan with a few
            spoons of Bolognese, a good grating of Parmesan and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.</li>
        <li>Toss to coat the spaghetti, loosening with a splash of cooking water, if needed.</li>
        <li>Divide the spaghetti between plates or bowls, add a good spoonful of Bolognese to each, then serve with a
            fine grating of Parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
